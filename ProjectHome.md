GanttMVC is a utility written in MVC pattern,so it will be more usable.There are many project tools which contains gannt module,but we can not find many unattached gantt utility.So,I wrote this package.But,what you should know is that it is written in SWT,so you can just use it in your Eclipse SWT/JFace project.Anyway,it is such a wonderful tool that you can add more features as you like.
